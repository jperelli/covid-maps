# covid-maps

I'm parsing the data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ on the fly and generating a static map image to share with og: tags in twitter

This is mainly an experiment to use [osm-static-maps](https://github.com/jperelli/osm-static-maps) in vercel to generate a "dynamic" image to share in social media.

See it working in https://covid-maps.vercel.com
